## Additional Notes

This project includes physics simulations and visual effects that may cause:
- Mesmerization and loss of time perception
- Spontaneous appreciation for embedded programming
- Uncontrollable urge to explore more matrix effects
- Philosophical questions about the nature of digital reality

The authors are not responsible for:
- ESP32 boards achieving self-awareness
- Matrix effects becoming too realistic
- Users questioning their own reality
- Coffee going cold while watching particle physics

Use responsibly. The matrix is infinite, but your free time isn't.

Remember: There is no spoon... but there are 101 ways to watch the rain fall.
